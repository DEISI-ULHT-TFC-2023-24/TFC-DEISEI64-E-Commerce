## **Introduction**

The recommendation of products plays a vital role in the landscape of e-commerce. 
As online stores continue to grow, this aspect becomes one of the main drivers of success and competitiveness in the market. Therefore, enhancing the
accuracy of recommendations has become a fundamental goal.
With a view towards application in recommendation systems, in this Final
Coursework (TFC), we explore a dataset containing over 500,000 records of purchases
from a gift store. The intention is to use this data to create a network structure that
allows us to explore various network analysis methodologies. We aim to relate
products, purchases, and customers, extracting information from these relationships
to make more effective recommendations.

Either open the file **Queries.ipynb** with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

***OR***

Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) to open the file locally.

## **Libraries**

Before running the queries, it is required to install these packages in the VSCode terminal

Package | Installation
